# A pluralistic framework for measuring, interpreting and decomposing heterogeneity in meta-analysis

## Overview

This is a repository containing the data and code for the illustration of the two case studies reported in

>  Anonymized. A pluralistic framework for measuring, interpreting and stratifying heterogeneity in meta-analysis. 2025.

## Structure

The repository contains the following folders:

- data

- benchmark

- function

- R

### `data` folder

The `data` folder includes the raw data files used for the case study.

### `benchmark` folder

The `benchmark` folder includes the data that can determine the percentile range in which the heterogeneity estimates for a particular meta-analysis fall, based on the heterogeneity distribution of the published meta-analyses.

### `Function` folder

The `function` folder includes the custom R function used to generate the sample figures shown in the main text.

### `R` folder

The `R` folder includes the R scripts used to reproduce all figures shown in the main text. The scripts are formatted both in Rmarkdown (`case_study_updated_V2.Rmd`) and html (`case_study_updated_V2.html`).
