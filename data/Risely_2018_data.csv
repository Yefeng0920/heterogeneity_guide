Tracking Natal Origins of Parasitized vs. Uninfected Monarch Butterflies Overwintering in Mexico,PLOS ONE,2015,"Long-distance migration can lower parasite prevalence if strenuous journeys remove infected animals from wild populations. We examined wild monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) to investigate the potential costs of the protozoan Ophryocystis elektroscirrha on migratory success. We collected monarchs from two wintering sites in central Mexico to compare infection status with hydrogen isotope (?2H) measurements as an indicator of latitude of origin at the start of fall migration. On average, uninfected monarchs had lower ?2H values than parasitized butterflies, indicating that uninfected butterflies originated from more northerly latitudes and travelled farther distances to reach Mexico. Within the infected class, monarchs with higher quantitative spore loads originated from more southerly latitudes, indicating that heavily infected monarchs originating from farther north are less likely to reach Mexico. We ruled out the alternative explanation that lower latitudes give rise to more infected monarchs prior to the onset of migration using citizen science data to examine regional differences in parasite prevalence during the summer breeding season. We also found a positive association between monarch wing area and estimated distance flown. Collectively, these results emphasize that seasonal migrations can help lower infection levels in wild animal populations. Our findings, combined with recent declines in the numbers of migratory monarchs wintering in Mexico and observations of sedentary (winter breeding) monarch populations in the southern U.S., suggest that shifts from migratory to sedentary behavior will likely lead to greater infection prevalence for North American monarchs.",O,Movement,Distance travelled,na,Monarch butterly,Danaus plexippus,Insect,Lepidoptera,Nymphalidae,Ophryocystis elektroscirrha,Protozoa,Non-breeding,Field,all,Single,Y,175,100,75,Not presented,12.78,Wald X2,<0.0001,1.00E-04,1,Infection status,-0.28,0.01,-0.56,0.02,0.02,"pes(0.0001,100,75) or chies(12.78,175)",Negative

Parasites had little effect on monarch survival or reproduction, except at the highest dose, Monarchs inoculated with 1000 spores per larva had decreased survival to eclosion, and this effect was more severe when larvae were inoculated at an earlier stage (first versus third instar).

The mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is the most numerous and widespread dabbling duck in the world, and one of the most important natural hosts for studying IAV transmission dynamics. In order to predict the likelihood of IAV transmission between individual ducks and to other hosts, as well as between geographical regions, it is important to understand how IAV infection affects the host. In this study, we analysed the movements of 40 mallards equipped with GPS transmitters and three-dimensional accelerometers, of which 20 were naturally infected with low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV), at a major stopover site in the Northwest European flyway. Movements differed substantially between day and night, as well as between mallards returning to the capture site and those feeding in natural habitats. However, movement patterns did not differ between LPAIV infected and uninfected birds. Hence, LPAIV infection probably does not affect mallard movements during stopover, with high possibility of virus spread along the migration route as a consequence.",O,Movement,Local movements,na,Mallard,Anas platyrhynchos,Bird,Anseriformes,Anatidae,LPAIV,Virus,Migration,Field,all,Single,N,87,37,50,Not presented,0.538,t,>0.05,0.5,0,Infection status,-0.06,0.01,-0.12,0.05,0.05,"tes(0.538,37,50)",Negative

This diversity includes eight Haemoproteus and 10 Plasmodium lineages of which most probably represent good biological species. Contrary to expectation, the relative frequency of parasite lineages seemed not to change over the 17-year study period and we found no effects of the parasites on a male secondary sexual ornament (song repertoire size) and two measures of fitness (adult survival and production of recruited offspring). We discuss whether the absence of fitness consequences of the parasites might relate to the fact that we have studied the host at the breeding sites in Europe, whereas the transmission seems to take place at the wintering sites in Africa, where the naive birds encounter the parasites for the first time and the resulting primary infections likely make them sicker than during the chronic phase of the infection. The prevalence of the three most common lineages appeared to fluctuate in parallel with a periodicity of approximately 3-4 years.

In the colonially nesting cliff swallow (Hirundo pyrrhonota), we manipulated ectoparasite load (of cimicid bugs, fleas, and chewing lice) by fumigating adults and comparing annual survivorship of fumigated birds and non-fumigated control birds captured at the same time. Mark-recapture experiments over an 8-year period revealed that non-fumigated birds had an annual survivorship about 12% less than chat of fumigated birds, on average, but the effects did not vary with colony size. Based on the difference in survivorship between fumigated and non-fumigated birds, we estimated that parasitized individuals had an annual survivorship of 0.38, compared with 0.57 for non-parasitized birds. The parasite-caused reduction in survivorship was the equivalent of the host losing up to one year of lifetime reproductive success. Ectoparasites did not preferentially infest hosts of lower quality, suggesting that all birds in the population were at potential risk of suffering parasitism and the resulting reductions in survivorship.

Yearling breeders were infected at a significantly lower rate than adults, and no yearlings in wintering roosts were infected. Haemoproteus prognei might be more virulent in immunologically naive birds and cause high mortality in young birds during the stress of their first migration. Many birds became infected over three years and most maintained a chronic infection. Infected birds returned to the colony with the same frequency as uninfected birds. Infected adults tended to arrive at the breeding site ahead of uninfected adults. Clutch size did not differ, but uninfected females had lower breeding success than infected individuals.

Prevalence of infection for magnolia Dendroica magnolia (36.3%; n=383), yellow-rumped D. coronata (58.3%; n=518), and yellow warblers D. petechia (12.7%; n=205) was approximately two times higher than reported in other migration studies and similar to infection rates found in breeding areas. Probability and intensity of infection were higher for later migrating yellow-rumped warblers, especially in younger (second-year) birds. Furthermore, we found a negative trend between intensity of infection and energetic condition for second-year yellow-rumped warblers. Haematozoan infection was not associated with refueling rate for any species. Our results indicate that for some migrants, especially younger birds, probability and intensity of haematozoan infection are related to later migration timing and reduced energetic condition during spring migration, and thus may be important determinants of subsequent reproductive performance in breeding areas.",O,Phenology,Stop-over arrival,na,Yellow-rumped warbler,Setophaga coronata,Bird,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Haemoparasites,Protozoa,Migration,Field,all,Single,Y,518,300,218,0.09,Not presented,Not presented,<0.05,0.05,1,Infection status,-0.09,0.005,-0.17,0.01,0.01,"pes(0.05,300,217)",Negative

Whereas sea trout remain in near-shore waters throughout their marine migration, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts typically move quickly offshore into oceanic waters. It might therefore be predicted that salmon smolts would be less vulnerable to coastal stressors and less likely to be negatively affected by infestations of sea lice early in their marine phase. Groups of microtagged, hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon smolts were fed either untreated pellets or pellets incorporating the in-feed sea louse treatment SLICE (emamectin benzoate) prior to eight experimental releases in three marine locations over a 3-year period. In total, 74 324 smolts were released and analysis of tag recaptures from returning adult salmon showed that emamectin-treated smolts experienced increased survivorship and were 1.8 times more likely to return compared with control fish. These results suggest that sea lice-induced mortality on adult Atlantic salmon returns in Ireland can be significant, and that sea lice larvae emanating from farmed salmon may influence individual survivorship and population conservation status of wild salmon in these river systems.",E,Survival,Annual survival,Parasite removal,Atlantic salmon,Salmo salar,Fish,Salmoniformes,Salmonidae,L. salmonis,Mites,Breeding,Field,all,Single,N,74324,37189,37135,Not presented,90.87,X2,0.001,0.001,1,Infection status,-0.03,0.005,-0.07,5.40E-05,0.01,"chies(90.87,74324)",Negative

These birds become infected when ingesting seed shrimps (Ostracoda) that act as intermediate hosts, largely while on migration across Western Europe. The prevalence ranged from 4% to 14% per year and increased significantly over time. This long-term trend was further supported by studying 366 teal shot in 2006-2008, for which prevalence of C. megalops was 27.6%. We found no evidence to suggest that this increase in prevalence has been caused by an increase in temperature, but eutrophication and an increase in duck densities are potential contributing factors. Adult teal were more likely to be infected than first-year birds and females more so than males, probably due to differences in diet and/or habitat use. Within a given age-sex class, heavier birds were more infected than lighter ones, suggesting low pathogenicity and a causal effect of ingestion rate.

Ectoparasites, by definition, are those which incur costs to their host, but these costs may vary. Examples of avian ectoparasites are chewing lice which feed exclusively on dead feather or skin material; therefore, costs to their bird hosts are generally considered small. Theoretically, many possible proximate effects exist, like loss of tissue or food, infected bites, transmission of microparasitic diseases or reduced body insulation due to loss of feathers, which may ultimately also have fitness consequences. Here, we experimentally examined a possible negative impact of 2 feather-eating louse species (Meropoecus meropis and Brueelia apiastri) on male and female European bee-eaters (Merops apiaster) by removing or increasing louse loads and comparing their impact to a control group (lice removed and immediately returned) after 1 month. A negative effect of chewing lice was found on body mass and sedimentation rate and to a lesser extent on haematocrit levels. Males and females lost more weight when bearing heavy louse loads, and were more susceptible to infestations as indicated by the higher sedimentation rate.

This study investigated the use of a rapid, nonlethal, external examination to assess the condition of run-of-the-river juvenile steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss migrating from the Snake River to the Pacific Ocean. We compared the external condition (e. g., body injuries, descaling, external signs of disease, fin damage, and ectoparasite infestations) with (1) the internal condition of a steelhead as measured by the presence of selected pathogens detected by histopathology and polymerase chain reaction analysis and (2) out-migration survival through the Snake and Columbia rivers as determined by passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag technology. The results from steelhead captured and euthanized (n = 222) at Lower Monumental Dam on the lower Snake River in 2008 indicated that external condition was significantly correlated with selected measures of internal condition. The odds of testing positive for a pathogen were 39.2, 24.3, and 5.6 times greater for steelhead with severe or moderate external signs of disease or more than 20% descaling, respectively. Capture-recapture models of 22,451 PIT-tagged steelhead released at Lower Monumental Dam in 2007-2009 indicated that external condition was significantly correlated with juvenile survival. The odds of out-migration survival for steelhead with moderate or severe external signs of disease, more than 20% descaling, or severe fin damage were 5.7, 4.9, 1.6, and 1.3 times lower, respectively, than those for steelhead without these external conditions.

Infection prevalence increased with age (p < 0.001, R(adj)(2) = 0.71). Prevalence in the catches strongly depended on target school size and was thus higher in trawl catches. We found strong seasonality in infection prevalence within years, with peaks in summer and winter.

We conducted a meta-analysis of replicated manipulative field experiments concerning the influence of parasitism by crustaceans on the marine survival of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). The data include 24 trials in which tagged smolts (totalling 283 347 fish; 1996-2008) were released as paired control and parasiticide-treated groups into 10 areas of Ireland and Norway. All experimental fish were infection-free when released into freshwater, and a proportion of each group was recovered as adult recruits returning to coastal waters 1 or more years later. Treatment had a significant positive effect on survival to recruitment, with an overall effect size (odds ratio) of 1.29 that corresponds to an estimated loss of 39 per cent (95% CI: 18-55%) of adult salmon recruitment. The parasitic crustaceans were probably acquired during early marine migration in areas that host large aquaculture populations of domesticated salmon, which elevate local abundances of ectoparasitic copepods-particularly Lepeophtheirus salmonis.

Throughout the year migrants are exposed to different sets of parasites, which may affect life history traits such as migratory schedules. Here, we studied the relationship between parasite infection and arrival date of blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla to their breeding grounds in Germany throughout a period of six years (2007-2012). We used two data sets, one that included all blackcaps and one that included only recaptured birds. We assesed whether parasites influence spring arrival to breeding grounds, and for the recaptured data set, we analysed temporal variation in parasitism (i.e. infection status and parasitaemia) throughout the breeding season. We used both microscopy and PCR (a fragment of 479 bp of the mtDNA cyt b) to determine haemosporidian infection. Blackcaps were mostly infected with Haemoproteus parabelopolskyi (lineages SYAT01 and SYAT02). Infection status, but not parasitaemia, was constant through time for individual birds; meaning that once a bird is infected, it most likely will retain the infection for life. We found that infection by haemosporidian parasites has no relationship to arrival date in this blackcap population; however, infection by H. parabelopolskyi has a marginally significant effect on arrival date of recaptured blackcaps, somewhat delaying their arrival to breeding grounds. Birds captured later in the season were more likely to be infected than those from early spring, and parasitaemia was frequently lower in birds captured earlier in the season compared to those captured later (summer).",O,Body stores,Condition index,na,Blackcap,Sylvia atricapilla,Bird,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Haemoparasites,Protozoa,Breeding,Field,all,Single,Y,297,208,89,Not presented,-1.2,Not presented,0.23,0.23,0,Infection status,-0.07,0.005,-0.15,0.02,0.02,"pes(0.23,207.9,89.1)",Negative

Here, we studied the relationship between parasite infection and arrival date of blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla to their breeding grounds in Germany throughout a period of six years (2007-2012). We used two data sets, one that included all blackcaps and one that included only recaptured birds. We assesed whether parasites influence spring arrival to breeding grounds, and for the recaptured data set, we analysed temporal variation in parasitism (i.e. infection status and parasitaemia) throughout the breeding season. We used both microscopy and PCR (a fragment of 479 bp of the mtDNA cyt b) to determine haemosporidian infection. Blackcaps were mostly infected with Haemoproteus parabelopolskyi (lineages SYAT01 and SYAT02). Infection status, but not parasitaemia, was constant through time for individual birds; meaning that once a bird is infected, it most likely will retain the infection for life. We found that infection by haemosporidian parasites has no relationship to arrival date in this blackcap population; however, infection by H. parabelopolskyi has a marginally significant effect on arrival date of recaptured blackcaps, somewhat delaying their arrival to breeding grounds.

Moreover, migration could amplify the costs of parasitism if animals suffering from parasite-induced damage or depleted energy reserves are less able to migrate long distances. We investigated relationships between long-distance migration, infection, and immunity in wild fall-migrating monarch butterflies Danaus plexippus. Monarchs migrate annually from eastern North America to central Mexico, accumulating lipids essential for migration and winter survival as they travel southward. Monarchs are commonly infected by the debilitating protozoan parasite Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE). We collected data on lipid reserves, parasite loads, and two immune measures (hemocyte concentration and phenoloxidase activity) from wild monarchs migrating through north GA (USA) to ask whether (1) parasite infection negatively affects lipid reserves, and (2) greater investment in lipid reserves is associated with lower immune measures. Results showed that monarchs sampled later in the fall migration had lower but not significantly different immune measures and significantly higher lipid reserves than those sampled earlier. Lipid measures correlated negatively but only nearly significantly with one measure of immune defense (phenoloxidase activity) in both healthy and infected monarchs, but did not depend on monarch infection status or parasite load. These results provide weak support for a trade-off between energy reserves and immune defense in migrants, and suggest that previously-demonstrated costs of OE infection for monarch migration are not caused by depleted lipid reserves.",O,Body stores,Lean mass,na,Monarch butterfly,Danaus plexippus,Insect,Lepidoptera,Nymphalidae,Ophryocystis elektroscirrha,Protozoa,Migration,Field,all,Single,Y,74,25,49,Not presented,6.5,F,0.013,0.013,1,Infection status,-0.29,0.01,-0.62,0.06,0.06,"pes(0.013,25,49)",Negative

However, actual variations in population size can often be driven by other demographic parameters, such as juvenile survival, when they show high temporal variability. We used capture-recapture data from a long-term study of a hunted, migratory species, the greater snow goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica), to assess temporal variability in first-year survival and the relative importance of natural and hunting mortality. We also conducted a parasite-removal experiment to determine the effect of internal parasites and body condition on temporal variation in juvenile survival. We found that juvenile survival showed a higher temporal variability than adult survival and that natural mortality was more important than hunting mortality, unlike in adults. Parasite removal increased first-year survival and reduced its annual variability in females only. Body condition at fledging was also positively correlated with first-year survival in treated females. With reduced parasite load, females, which are thought to invest more in their immune system than males according to Bateman's principle, could probably reallocate more energy to growth than males, leading to a higher survival. Treated birds also had a higher survival than control ones during their second year, suggesting a developmental effect that manifested later in life.

A., & Klaassen, M.","Weak negative associations between avian influenza virus infection and movement behaviour in a key host species, the mallard Anas platyrhynchos",OIKOS,2015,"Animal movements may contribute to the spread of pathogens. In the case of avian influenza virus, [migratory] birds have been suggested to play a role in the spread of some highly pathogenic strains (e.g. H5N1, H5N8), as well as their low pathogenic precursors which circulate naturally in wild birds. For a better understanding of the emergence and spread of both highly pathogenic (HPAIV) and low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV), the potential effects of LPAIVs on bird movement need to be evaluated. In a key host species, the mallard Anas platyrhynchos, we tested whether LPAIV infection status affected daily local (< 100 m) and regional (> 100 m) movements by comparing movement behaviour 1) within individuals (captured and sampled at two time points) and 2) between individuals (captured and sampled at one time point). We fitted free-living adult males with GPS loggers throughout the autumn LPAIV infection peak, and sampled them for LPAIV infection at logger deployment and at logger removal on recapture. Within individuals, we found no association between LPAIV infection and daily local and regional movements. Among individuals, daily regional movements of LPAIV infected mallards in the last days of tracking were lower than those of non-infected birds. Moreover, these regional movements of LPAIV infected birds were additionally reduced by poor weather conditions (i.e. increased wind and/or precipitation and lower temperatures). Local movements of LPAIV infected birds in the first days of tracking were higher when temperature decreased. Our study thus demonstrates that bird-assisted dispersal rate of LPAIV may be lower on a regional scale than expected on the basis of the movement behaviour of non-infected birds. Our study underlines the importance of understanding the impact of pathogen infection on host movement in order to assess its potential role in the emergence and spread of infectious diseases.",O,Movement,Distance travelled,na,Mallard,Anas platyrhynchos,Bird,Anseriformes,Anatidae,LPAIV,Virus,Non-breeding,Field,all,Single,N,22,13,9,Not presented,-4.3,t,0.001,0.001,1,Infection status,-0.75,0.05,-1.61,0.23,0.23,"pes(0.001,13,9)",Negative

Low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) infection is thought to have negligible impacts on wild birds; however, effects of infection in free-living birds are largely unstudied. We investigated the extent to which LPAIV infection and shedding were associated with body condition and immune status in free-living mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), a partially migratory key LPAIV host species. We sampled mallards throughout the species' annual autumn LPAIV infection peak, and we classified individuals according to age, sex, and migratory strategy (based on stable hydrogen isotope analysis) when analyzing data on body mass and five indices of immune status. Body mass was similar for LPAIV-infected and noninfected birds. The degree of virus shedding from the cloaca and oropharynx was not associated with body mass. LPAIV infection and shedding were not associated with natural antibody (NAbs) and complement titers (first lines of defense against infections), concentrations of the acute phase protein haptoglobin (Hp), ratios of heterophils to lymphocytes (H:L ratio), and avian influenza virus (AIV)-specific antibody concentrations. NAbs titers were higher in LPAIV-infected males and local (i.e., short distance) migrants than in infected females and distant (i.e., long distance) migrants. Hp concentrations were higher in LPAIV-infected juveniles and females compared to infected adults and males. NAbs, complement, and Hp levels were lower in LPAIV-infected mallards in early autumn. Our study demonstrates weak associations between infection with and shedding of LPAIV and the body condition and immune status of free-living mallards. These results may support the role of mallards as asymptomatic carriers of LPAIV and raise questions about possible coevolution between virus and host.",O,Body stores,Body mass,na,Mallard,Anas platyrhynchos,Bird,Anseriformes,Anatidae,LPAIV,Virus,Migration,Field,all,Single,N,287,86,201,Not presented,Not presented,X2,0.8,0.8,0,Infection status,-0.01,0.005,-0.03,0.02,0.02,"pes(0.8,86.1,200.9)",None
